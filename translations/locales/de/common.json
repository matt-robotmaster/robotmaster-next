  "about-story-1": "Robotmaster helps manufacturers to maximize their productivity by easy and efficient robot programming. Our leading off-line programming software provides quick and easy programming tools for multiple applications, saving time and money while maximizing return on investment.",
  "about-story-2": "The idea was born in 2001 - we were unwilling to accept the prevailing industry belief that teaching was the best way to program industrial robots. We set out to show that off-line programming powered by CAD/CAM software was the key to productivity and quality.",
  "about-story-3": "In 2002, we unveiled the first version of Robotmaster CAD/CAM robotic software. An overwhelmingly positive response from robot integrators and manufacturers proved we were on the right track. This led us to combine our expertise in CAD/CAM software development technologies with applied mathematics and robot kinematics to perfect and extend the suite of functionalities found in Robotmaster software.",
  "about-story-4": "In the years that followed, we continued to evolve the software, expanding to support a vast array of industrial robots across multiple industries. Today Robotmaster-powered robots are adept at jobs such as trimming and cutting, machining, deburring, welding, polishing, sanding, painting and more.",
  "about-story-5": "The capabilities of Robotmaster have not gone unnoticed, winning praise and accolades from customers and media alike. The software’s ability to make the programming of industrial robots fast, easy, and efficient earned it the Game Changer Award for Motion Control at the 2013 RoboBusiness Conference. In 2015, CIO Review Magazine named us to its list of the 20 Most Promising Robotics Solutions Providers.",
  "about-story-6": "Now part of the Hypertherm family, operating as Hypertherm Robotic Software Inc., we are able to leverage Hypertherm’s global infrastructure to serve rapidly evolving industry requirements and challenges and make it easier for robotic programmers and integrators worldwide to achieve optimal results.",
